-Manager needs not to sign up,just logs in,we can hardcode his username and password in the database
-For the workers and customers we create two tables in the database that will store their information when they sign up
-The information will be used for logging in too
-We can also hardcode the names and roles of teh workers in the database,casue we already have them in the question
-Lemme create html templates to bring you all on board
